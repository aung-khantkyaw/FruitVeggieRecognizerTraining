# Fruit and Vegetable Recognizer Training

This project is focused on training a machine learning model to recognize various fruits and vegetables from images. The trained model can be used for applications such as inventory management, dietary tracking, or educational tools.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation.
- Training pipeline for classification models.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Support for custom datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aung-khantkyaw/FruitVeggieRecognizerTraining.git
   cd FruitVeggieRecognizerTraining
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. You can get dataset from [Dataset - Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset From Kaggle by Kritik Seth](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
